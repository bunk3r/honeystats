The site requires maxmind GeoIP library.

You DON'T need to install it on php, just use this static inc file and the dat DB.

You can update these files from:

- downloaded geoip.inc - [https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-php/blob/master/src/]
- downloaded GeoIP.dat - [http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/]
